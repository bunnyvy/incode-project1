# Beginner: My First Ever Project Mr.Coffee at INCODE ଘ(˵•-•)☆
- Mr.Coffee requires us to build a simple basic website using **HTML & CSS**:
  - Home page (index.html)
  - About us page (about.html)
  - Contact us page (contact.html)
  - CSS sheet to edit the styles of 3 pages (application.css)
- Mr. Coffee is based in France, the content therefore centered around French to target the local community
- Mr. Coffee also

 ## Learning Journey + Reflection
 - Upon my reflection on the first HTML & CSS project, I realised it was indeed a steep learning curve for me to learn about the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
 - I learned that HTML's full name is HyperText Markup Language and CSS's fulll name is Cascading Style Sheet, and understood that HTML is a markup language to be displayed in a web browser, where its accompany partners could be: CSS & Javascript. (Super basic I know (ꈍ⌓ꈍ✿))
 - I learned that persistency and taking breaks are important during the learning journey, especially for beginners who do not have a background in HTML or CSS
 - DO NOT PANIC! One step at a time, even though it sometimes can be overwhelming for us a a beginner, taking one step at a time is crucially important in understanding the errors you are getting instead of panicking and thinking that you cannot solve it!
 - JUST MAKE THAT MISTAKE! Being a perfectionist and an overly-critical person, I find it hard to start the project as I am afraid of seeing the errors in my code, and this leads to procastination, taking the first step is important, I know it takes a lot of courage, but we gotta do it! and most importantly, believe in ourselves :)
 - WATCH A YOUTUBE TUTORIAL! If you ever feel overwhelm, just watch a youtube tutorial before you start the project, this helps you to understand the basic, the purpose of HTML and CSS before diving in straight into the technicalities.
 - MAKE NOTES! I cannot stress this enough, but making notes help me to understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, e.g. Meta Tags <title> can actually improve Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)! basic stuff that we need to know really.
 
## Steps + Approaches
 - Step 1: To start the project, I first create a folder (www) which consists of the 3 HTML pages: Home page, About Us page and Contact Us page; 1 CSS file, and the Images folder given by the client. 
 - Step 2: Learned how to develop the Header and Footer of HTML USING <div> tags 
 - Step 3: Developed each page's HTML content
 - Step 4: Make the pages responsive
 
 ## Future Learnings + Goals?
 - I am aware that my code now is NOT THE MOST CLEAN/PERFECT code, so I hope to learn to write a cleaner code along the way and most importantly, improves users interaction and user experience.
 - I hope to improve the responsiveness and interactive features of Mr.Coffee's website.
 - Since businesses always stress about SEO, I hope to learn and add some interactive elements to improve the SEO of Mr.Coffee's website.
